# continentsLargestCity
Programs outputs the continents largest city.
I create these readme files because I heard it was good practice.
I am unsure of how important these readme files are when it comes to small programs like such.
However, here we have six cases or scenarios that can occur when the input is given. 
Each number represents a given contintent and once the input is given the largest city for that continent is outputted to the users terminal.
